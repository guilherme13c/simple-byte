<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The exponential escalation in computational demands—spurred by machine learning, high-performance computing (HPC), and real-time rendering—has catalyzed the evolution of heterogeneous computing paradigms. At the center of this landscape lie two pivotal processing architectures: the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). Each possesses unique microarchitectural characteristics optimized for different classes of workloads. An in-depth understanding of their respective capabilities and limitations is indispensable for advanced system design and optimization.</p>
<p>Conceptually, the CPU serves as a control-centric processing unit with architectural versatility, favoring complex, serial execution patterns. Conversely, the GPU epitomizes data-parallel compute density, engineered for throughput over latency, originally tailored for rasterization pipelines and now repurposed for data-intensive applications such as tensor computations and massive parallel simulations.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-is-a-cpu-central-processing-unit">What is a CPU (Central Processing Unit)?</h2>
<p>The CPU is the primary execution engine in general-purpose computing systems. Architecturally, it features a limited number of powerful, out-of-order superscalar cores, each capable of handling multiple instruction threads via simultaneous multithreading (SMT). These cores are augmented by deep cache hierarchies and speculative execution pipelines, enabling efficient management of control-dependent logic and non-uniform memory access (NUMA) patterns.</p>
<p>CPUs are highly optimized for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Branch-heavy execution flows</li>
<li>System-level orchestration (e.g., OS kernel, interrupt handling)</li>
<li>Low-latency I/O control and context switching</li>
<li>Sequential or moderately parallel workloads with high instruction diversity</li>
</ul>
<p>While contemporary CPUs integrate vector instruction sets (e.g., AVX, SSE) and multi-core parallelism, their architectural design imposes constraints on massive data-level parallelism due to limited thread and core scalability relative to GPUs.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-is-a-gpu-graphics-processing-unit">What is a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)?</h2>
<p>GPUs originated as fixed-function accelerators for rendering pipelines but have since evolved into fully programmable, massively parallel processors. The canonical GPU architecture comprises thousands of scalar or vector ALUs (Arithmetic Logic Units) organized into Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs). These units execute instructions in a SIMD or SIMT (Single Instruction, Multiple Threads) paradigm, which is ideal for problems with high spatial or temporal data locality.</p>
<p>Modern GPUs are indispensable for compute-intensive domains including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deep neural network inference and training</li>
<li>3D rendering and real-time ray tracing</li>
<li>Molecular dynamics and fluid simulations</li>
<li>Cryptographic hashing and zero-knowledge proof generation</li>
</ul>
<p>GPUs excel in executing uniform instruction streams over large datasets, with performance predicated on high arithmetic intensity and minimal branching divergence. Their execution model emphasizes throughput maximization, often at the cost of increased latency and programmability complexity.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="key-architectural-differences">Key Architectural Differences</h2>
<p>At a fundamental level, CPUs and GPUs embody divergent philosophies of computation. CPUs are latency-optimized, emphasizing fast response to serial tasks, while GPUs are throughput-optimized, emphasizing maximal execution of concurrent tasks.</p>
<h3 id="execution-model">Execution Model</h3>
<p>CPUs implement a control-flow execution model, leveraging deep pipelines, speculative execution, and advanced branch prediction to accelerate irregular code paths. GPUs, in contrast, adhere to a SIMT model, where groups of threads (warps) execute in lockstep, making them highly efficient for uniform, data-parallel workloads but susceptible to performance penalties under divergent branching.</p>
<h3 id="thread-and-core-composition">Thread and Core Composition</h3>
<p>A typical CPU may include 4–64 cores, each supporting 2–4 threads, emphasizing high per-thread performance. In contrast, a high-end GPU may contain several thousand threads organized into blocks and grids, distributed across hundreds of simpler cores with shared instruction fetch units. This divergence allows GPUs to hide memory and instruction latencies via massive multithreading.</p>
<h3 id="memory-hierarchies">Memory Hierarchies</h3>
<p>CPUs leverage multi-level caches (L1–L3) to minimize memory access latency, whereas GPUs depend on a combination of shared memory, global memory, and register files. Efficient use of GPU memory hierarchies, including avoiding bank conflicts and ensuring coalesced access, is critical to achieving peak performance.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-graphics-pipeline-why-gpus-were-invented">The Graphics Pipeline: Why GPUs Were Invented</h2>
<p>The genesis of GPU architecture lies in the demands of the real-time graphics pipeline, which necessitates high-throughput computation over large datasets—vertices, textures, and pixels—processed through deterministic stages.</p>
<h3 id="key-stages">Key Stages</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vertex Processing:</strong> Applies transformations, lighting, and geometry operations.</li>
<li><strong>Rasterization:</strong> Converts geometric primitives into pixels.</li>
<li><strong>Fragment Processing:</strong> Determines final color, depth, and shader effects.</li>
</ul>
<p>These stages are inherently parallel, each operating on discrete input data with minimal interdependencies. The evolution of the fixed-function pipeline into programmable shaders catalyzed the transition from graphics-specific acceleration to general-purpose GPU computing (GPGPU).</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="matrix-multiplications-the-heart-of-gpu-computation">Matrix Multiplications: The Heart of GPU Computation</h2>
<p>Matrix operations form the computational backbone of modern GPU workloads, particularly in domains like linear algebra, convolutional neural networks, and finite element analysis. GPUs are architected to exploit the regularity and parallelism of matrix operations using tiled computation and fused multiply-add (FMA) pipelines.</p>
<p>For example, matrix-matrix multiplication (GEMM) maps naturally to GPU thread blocks, where each block computes a submatrix in parallel. Libraries such as cuBLAS and CUTLASS provide high-performance primitives for such operations, often achieving near-peak theoretical throughput.</p>
<p>This dominance in matrix-centric tasks underpins the GPU&rsquo;s pivotal role in training and deploying large-scale neural models such as transformers and CNNs.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="thread-types-and-execution-models">Thread Types and Execution Models</h2>
<p>GPUs use a hierarchical execution model: threads are grouped into warps (usually 32 threads), which are scheduled together on a single Streaming Multiprocessor. Warps are organized into blocks, which are in turn organized into grids.</p>
<p>This structure enables GPUs to scale across thousands of concurrent threads. Threads in a warp execute in SIMT fashion, which is efficient as long as threads follow the same execution path. Divergence (e.g., conditional branching within a warp) can cause serialization and performance degradation.</p>
<p>CPUs handle fewer threads but provide better performance per thread, featuring rich context switching capabilities and full control flow flexibility.</p>
